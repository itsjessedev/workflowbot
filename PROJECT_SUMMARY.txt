WORKFLOWBOT - PROJECT SUMMARY
==============================

Portfolio Project: Slack/Teams Process Automation Bot
Location: /home/jesse/itsjesse.dev/portfolio/workflowbot/

OVERVIEW
--------
Production-ready Slack bot for automating internal processes like PTO requests,
expense approvals, and employee onboarding. Includes demo mode for portfolio
presentation without requiring Slack credentials.

STATISTICS
----------
- ~2,500 lines of code
- 20+ Python modules
- 3 complete workflows
- 10+ API endpoints
- 10+ test cases
- Full Docker setup
- Comprehensive documentation

DEMO OPTIONS
------------
1. Interactive Console Demo (no dependencies)
   python src/main.py --demo

2. Docker Demo
   docker-compose --profile demo up demo

3. API Server + Swagger UI

4. Full Slack Integration (requires tokens)
   Set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, SLACK_APP_TOKEN
   Run normally

WORKFLOWS IMPLEMENTED
---------------------

1. PTO REQUEST
   - Interactive form for dates and reason
   - Automatic calculation of business days
   - Routes to manager (short) or manager+HR (long)
   - Calendar integration ready
   - Balance tracking capability

2. EXPENSE APPROVAL
   - Amount, category, description, receipt
   - Amount-based routing: <$500 manager, ≥$500 manager+finance
   - Receipt upload support
   - Reimbursement tracking
   - Budget validation hooks

3. EMPLOYEE ONBOARDING
   - Department-specific checklist generation
   - Multi-stakeholder coordination (IT, HR, Manager)
   - Task assignment and tracking
   - Progress monitoring
   - Welcome automation

PRODUCTION FEATURES
-------------------
- Async database operations for performance
- Connection pooling and optimization
- Redis caching layer
- Celery background tasks
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging
- Health check endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Security best practices
- Database migrations ready
- Monitoring hooks (Sentry ready)

TESTING
-------
- Unit tests for all workflows
- Integration tests for API
- Database tests with in-memory SQLite
- Async test support
- pytest fixtures for setup/teardown
- Coverage reporting ready

DEPLOYMENT
----------
- Multi-stage Dockerfile
- Docker Compose with PostgreSQL + Redis
- Health checks configured

- Volume mounts for uploads
- Environment-based configuration
- Production/staging/dev configs

EXTENSIBILITY
-------------
Easy to add new workflows:
1. Create workflow definition in src/workflows/
2. Add validation and routing logic
3. Register in workflow registry
4. Add API endpoints if needed
5. Add tests
6. Document
